## What's Shakin?
Mapping Earthquakes with JavaScript, GeoJSON, D3.js library, Leaflet and Mapbox APIs to visually show the differences between magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world in the last 7 days. Data from the [USGS website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php)  mapped the coordinates. Used the Leaflet lirary to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.

### Multiple maps were created to include mega quakes, techtonic plates and addtional layers to view sattelite, street and dark modes:

### An Additional map shows the relation between oregons and seismic activity. Oregony is an event that leads to structureal deformation of the Earth at convergent plate margins:
